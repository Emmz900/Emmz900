- I’m Emma Menzies. I recently studied Professional Data Analysis at Codeclan, mainly using R with some SQL. We covered data cleaning, wrangling, visualisation, statistics, and machine learning.
- I am now seeking a job in data analysis.
- Alongside my job search I am aiming to learn about Power BI, cloud services, and improve my python abilities.
- My interests include energy, renewable power, climate change, and sustainability.
