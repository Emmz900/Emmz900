Hi, I’m Emma Menzies. I recently studied Data Analysis at Codeclan, mainly using R with some SQL. We covered data cleaning, wrangling, visualisation, and machine learning.
Due to the liquidation of Codeclan a few weeks before our graduation I am now self learning python for data analysis having previously learned the basics of python and object-oriented programming (OOP) through online courses.
