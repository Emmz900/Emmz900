- I’m Emma Menzies. I recently studied Professional Data Analysis at Codeclan, mainly using R with some SQL. We covered data cleaning, wrangling, visualisation, and machine learning.
- Due to the liquidation of Codeclan a couple of weeks before our graduation I am now self learning python for data analysis having previously learned the basics of python and object-oriented programming (OOP) through online courses.
- I am now seeking a job in data analysis with particular interest in energy, renewable power, climate change, and sustainability.
